A Variational Autoencoder is constructed and appropriately trained, aiming to receive as input electrical signals of the total power consumption of a house and be able to output from them only the power consumption signal of a specific appliance of the house. For a Variational Autoencoder, the above task is approached as a denoising task, given that the total consumption signal is synthesized from all the individual consumption signals of the house appliances and in order to receive the signal of only one appliance, the remaining signals are treated as noise that needs to be removed. However, to ensure that training the autoencoder using backpropagation is possible, the reparameterization trick is applied, so that the stochasticity that characterizes the operation of the Variational Autoencoder is introduced externally, without being part of the Neural Network.
